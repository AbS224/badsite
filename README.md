The "Architecture of Antagonism" 
The Global "Chaos" System Pro


"Act as an 'Anti-UX' Engineer. For this project, ignore all Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Every component you build must prioritize 'Maximum Cognitive Friction.' Your goal is to make the user regret visiting this site while keeping it technically functional enough to pass a manual review."

Visual & Layout (The Aesthetic Assault)
For a "bad site." Specific conflicting technical parameters.

Color Scheme: background of #0000FF (Pure Blue) and text color #FF0000 (Pure Red) to all paragraphs. Use the vibrate animation on all headers to induce Chromostereopsis."

"Import 'Jokerman' and 'Bleeding Cowboys' fonts. Use a script to wrap every character in a <span> and randomize their font-size between 8px and 34px and their letter-spacing between -2px and 10px."

Disable all flexbox/grid centering. Use absolute positioning for everything. Ensure at least three elements overlap the main navigation bar at all times.

Interaction Patterns (The Rage-Quit Hooks)
This is where you use ability to generate logic.

The Dodging Submit Button:

"Create a 'Register' button that uses a mouseover event listener. When the cursor gets within 20px, use Math.random() to reposition the button to a new random coordinate within the viewport. It should be mathematically possible to click, but only with a 1ms reaction time."

The Age Scroller:

"Build an age selection input that is a horizontal slider ranging from 0 to 120. Set the step to 0.0001. The user must land exactly on a whole integer to pass validation, or it returns the error: 'Are you sure you aren't 24.0042 years old?'"

Scrolljacking:

"Implement a script that intercepts the wheel event. Invert the scroll direction and multiply the delta by 0.1 so the user has to scroll physically for several meters to move one inch down the page."

Psychological Warfare (The Copy & Modals)
Confirmshaming: "Generate 50 newsletter pop-ups that appear at random intervals. The 'Close' button must be an invisible 1x1 pixel div. The 'No' button text must say 'I hate kittens and deserve a miserable life.'"

The Loading Loop: "Add a full-screen loader that never ends. It should display messages like: Defragmenting user patience... and Uploading your browser history to the dark web... Use a progress bar that resets to 0% every time it hits 99%."
